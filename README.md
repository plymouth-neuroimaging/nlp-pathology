# NLP models for the detection of pathology in radiology reports

This repository contains models which have been trained to classify radiological report texts in two areas: abnormality and small vessel disease. In both cases, five-fold cross-validation has been used to develop models, so five models have been shared for each category.

## Abnormality

These models have been trained to classify reports as "normal", "abnormal", or "not enough information".

## Small vessel disease

These models have been trained to classify reports as "no small vessel disease", "small vessel disease", or "not enough information".
